# SDL_Pong
![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/FqTOnbg.jpg?1 "Screenshot")

A Pong clone made with SDL2 and C++ for 2 players. The controls are available on the title Screen.

This is my first project made from scratch without any tutorials (just for the basics of SDL2) to test out the library 
and train myself in C++.

## Compiling
The repository contains the CodeBlocks project. You can also compile with gcc (make sure to add ```-std=c++11```).
You will need the following library to compile :

* SDL2
* SDL2_image
* SDL2_ttf
* SDL2_mixer

If you are on Windows, you can also test out the game with the executable in bin directory of the repository.
